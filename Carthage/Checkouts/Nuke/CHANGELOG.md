## Nuke 5.1.1

- Fix Swift 4 warnings
- Add `DataDecoder.sharedUrlCache` to easy access for shared `URLCache` object
- Add references to [RxNuke](https://github.com/kean/RxNuke)
- Minor improvements under the hood


## Nuke 5.1

- De facto `Manager` has already implemented `Loading` protocol in Nuke 5 (you could use it to load images directly w/o targets). Now it also conforms to `Loading` protocols which gives access to some convenience functions available in `Loading` extensions.
- Add `static func targetSize(for view: UIView) -> CGSize` method to `Decompressor`
- Simpler, faster `Preheater`
- Improved documentation


## Nuke 5.0.1

- #116 `Manager` can now be used to load images w/o specifying a target
- `Preheater` is now initialized with `Manager` instead of object conforming to `Loading` protocol


## Nuke 5.0

### Overview

Nuke 5 is a relatively small release which removes some of the complexity from the framework.

One of the major changes is the removal of promisified API as well as `Promise` itself. Promises were briefly added in Nuke 4 as an effort to simplify async code. The major downsides of promises are compelex memory management, extra complexity for users unfamiliar with promises, complicated debugging, performance penalties. Ultimately I decided that promises were adding more problems that they were solving. 

### Changes

#### Removed promisified API and `Promise` itself

- Remove promisified API, use simple closures instead. For example, `Loading` protocol's method `func loadImage(with request: Request, token: CancellationToken?) -> Promise<Image>` was replaced with a method with a completion closure `func loadImage(with request: Request, token: CancellationToken?, completion: @escaping (Result<Image>) -> Void)`. The same applies to `DataLoading` protocol.
- Remove `Promise` class
- Remove `PromiseResolution<T>` enum
- Remove `Response` typealias
- Add `Result<T>` enum which is now used as a replacement for `PromiseResolution<T>` (for instance, in `Target` protocol, etc)

#### Memory cache is now managed exclusively by `Manager`

- Remove memory cache from `Loader`
- `Manager` now not only reads, but also writes to `Cache`
- `Manager` now has new methods to load images w/o target (Nuke 5.0.1) 

The reason behind this change is to reduce confusion about `Cache` usage. In previous versions the user had to pass `Cache` instance to both `Loader` (which was both reading and writing to cache asynchronously), and to `Manager` (which was just reading from the cache synchronously). In a new setup it's clear who's responsible for managing memory cache.

#### Removed `DataCaching` and `CachingDataLoader`

Those two types were included in Nuke to make integrating third party caching libraries a bit easier. However, they were actually not that useful. Instead of using those types you could've just wrapped `DataLoader` yourself with a comparable amount of code and get much more control. For more info see [Third Party Libraries: Using Other Caching Libraries](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/Third%20Party%20Libraries.md#using-other-caching-libraries). 

#### Other Changes

- `Loader` constructor now provides a default value for `DataDecoding` object
- `DataLoading` protocol now works with a `Nuke.Request` and not `URLRequest` in case some extra info from `URLRequest` is required
- Reduce default `URLCache` disk capacity from 200 MB to 150 MB
- Reduce default `maxConcurrentOperationCount` of `DataLoader` from 8 to 6
- Shared objects (like `Manager.shared`) are now constants.
- `Preheater` is now initialized with `Manager` instead of `Loading` object
- Add new [Third Party Libraries](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/Third%20Party%20Libraries.md) guide.
- Improved documentation


## Nuke 4.1.2

Bunch of improvements in built-in `Promise`:
- `Promise` now also uses new `Lock` - faster creation, faster locking
- Add convenience `isPending`, `resolution`, `value` and `error` properties
- Simpler implementation migrated from [Pill.Promise](https://github.com/kean/Pill)*

*`Nuke.Promise` is a simplified variant of [Pill.Promise](https://github.com/kean/Pill) (doesn't allow `throws`, adds `completion`, etc). The `Promise` is built into Nuke to avoid fetching external dependencies.


## Nuke 4.1.1

- Fix deadlock in `Cache` - small typo, much embarrassment  üòÑ (https://github.com/kean/Nuke-Alamofire-Plugin/issues/8)


## Nuke 4.1 ‚ö°Ô∏è

Nuke 4.1 is all about **performance**. Here are some notable performance improvements:

- `loadImage(with:into:)` method with a default config is **6.3x** faster
- `Cache` operations (write/hit/miss) are from **3.1x** to **4.5x** faster

Nuke 4.0 focused on stability first, naturally there were some performance regressions. With the version 4.1 Nuke is again [the fastest framework](https://github.com/kean/Image-Frameworks-Benchmark) out there. The performance is ensured by a new set of performance tests.

If you're interested in the types of optimizations that were made check out recent commits. There is a lot of awesome stuff there!

Nuke 4.1 also includes a new [Performance Guide](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/Performance%20Guide.md) and a collection of [Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/master/Documentation/Guides/Tips%20and%20Tricks.md).

### Other Changes

- Add convenience method `loadImage(with url: URL, into target: AnyObject, handler: @escaping Handler)` (more useful than anticipated).
- #88 Add convenience `cancelRequest(for:)` function
- Use `@discardableResult` in `Promise` where it makes sense
- Simplified `Loader` implementation
- `Cache` nodes are no longer deallocated recursively on `removeAll()` and `deinit` (I was hitting stack limit in benchmarks, it's impossible in real-world use).
- Fix: All `Cache` public `trim()` methods are now thread-safe too.


## Nuke 4.0 üöÄ

### Overview
 
Nuke 4 has fully adopted the new **Swift 3** changes and conventions, including the new [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).
 
Nuke 3 was already a slim framework. Nuke 4 takes it a step further by simplifying almost all of its components.
 
Here's a few design principles adopted in Nuke 4:
 
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming.** Nuke 3 promised a lot of customization by providing a set of protocols for loading, caching, transforming images, etc. However, those protocols were vaguely defined and hard to implement in practice. Protocols in Nuke 4 are simple and precise, often consisting of a single method.
- **Single Responsibility Principle.** For example, instead of implementing preheating and deduplicating of equivalent requests in a single vague `ImageManager` class, those features were moved to separate classes (`Preheater`, `Deduplicator`). This makes core classes much easier to reason about.
- **Principle of Least Astonishment**. Nuke 3 had a several excessive protocols, classes and methods which are *all gone* now (`ImageTask`, `ImageManagerConfiguration` just to name a few). Those features are much easier to use now.
- **Simpler Async**. Image loading involves a lot of asynchronous code, managing it was a chore. Nuke 4 adopts two design patterns ([**Promise**](https://github.com/kean/Promise) and **CancellationToken**) that solve most of those problems.
 
The adoption of those design principles resulted in a simpler, more testable, and more concise code base (which is now under 900 slocs, compared to AlamofireImage's 1426, and Kingfisher's whopping 2357).
 
I hope that Nuke 4 is going to be a pleasure to use. Thanks for your interest üòÑ
 
You can learn more about Nuke 4 in an in-depth [**Nuke 4 Migration Guide**](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/master/Documentation/Migrations/Nuke%204%20Migration%20Guide.md).

### Highlighted New Features
 
#### LRU Memory Cache
 
Nuke 4 features a new custom LRU memory cache which replaced `NSCache`. The primary reason behind this change was the fact that `NSCache` [is not LRU](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/blob/master/Foundation/NSCache.swift). The new `Nuke.Cache` has some other benefits like better performance, and more control which would enable some new advanced features in future versions.

#### Rate Limiter
 
There is a known problem with `URLSession` that it gets trashed pretty easily when you resume and cancel `URLSessionTasks` at a very high rate (say, scrolling a large collection view with images). Some frameworks combat this problem by simply never cancelling `URLSessionTasks` which are already in `.running` state. This is not an ideal solution, because it forces users to wait for cancelled requests for images which might never appear on the display.
 
Nuke has a better, classic solution for this problem - it introduces a new `RateLimiter` class which limits the rate at which `URLSessionTasks` are created. `RateLimiter` uses a [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) algorithm. The implementation supports quick bursts of requests which can be executed without any delays when "the bucket is full". This is important to prevent the rate limiter from affecting "normal" requests flow. `RateLimiter` is enabled by default.
 
You can see `RateLimiter` in action in a new `Rate Limiter Demo` added in the sample project.

#### Toucan Plugin

Make sure to check out new [Toucan plugin](https://github.com/kean/Nuke-Toucan-Plugin) which provides a simple API for processing images. It supports resizing, cropping, rounded rect masking and more.
